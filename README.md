# Project Overview: 
  The project is structured into four main parts, each focusing on different areas of software development and AI solution building.
Python Fundamentals: Implementing fundamental Python concepts including data structures, object-oriented programming, and file I/O operations.
Data Science and Machine Learning: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) using popular libraries like pandas and matplotlib, followed by building a machine learning model for classification or regression tasks.
LLM Integration and Development: Leveraging a pre-trained large language model (LLM) for text processing tasks such as summarization and creative text generation. This part also showcases custom prompt engineering for steering LLM output.
Project Proposal: This section involves outlining a project proposal in a separate document, detailing the problem statement, target audience, unique solution approach, key features, and the role of Python and LLMs in technical implementation.
